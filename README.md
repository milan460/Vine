# Vine

The Vine App is an application that enables users to search through a diverse array of plants using a third-party API, providing detailed information about specific plants and reviews from owners. As a user, you have the option to add a plant to your favorites, which allows you to access more information about how to care for those plants. We have also integrated a marketplace that allows plant owners to list their plants for sale. Other users can then purchase these plants and call them their own.
