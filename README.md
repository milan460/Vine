Vine

The Vine App is an application that allows a user to search through a wide array of plants through a third-party API to learn more details about a particular plant and read reviews based on owners. As a user, you can add a particular plant to your favorites to learn more about the actions to take care of those plants. We implemented a marketplace to allow users who own plants to list them for sale which other users can purchase and call their own.
